# Free and Open Source Learning

## What is this?

**FOSL** is a collection of free (both as in *freedom* and as in *free*) learning materials, ranging from notes to exercises to slides. Contributions always welcome and encouraged. Yes, we know that **for now** it's only STEM stuff, bear with us (or better, contribute if you're in the position to do so!).

## How to contribute

* **New material:** [send us an e-mail](http://127.0.0.1:8000/contacts/) and we'll add you to the [GitHub organization](https://kekw.git
).   
    Requirements:
    1. A [GitHub](https://github.com) account (or at least someone willing to create and mantain the repo for you)
    2. Some material to share that won't get us in any legal trouble (pretty please)
    3. Elbow grease to take care of your repo
    4. I think that's all for now, if anything comes to mind ill'add later lmao
    
    Once you're in:
    
    1. Create the repo 
    2. Notify us so we can update the site. We'll ask for the following info:
        * Author(s)
        * Title
        * Category (e.g. notes, exercises, presentation)  
        * Language  
        * Status (see [this page](http://127.0.0.1:8000/legend/))  
        * Eventual comments about your work  
    
* **Contributions to existing material:** fork the repo, do your changes and commit

### Getting out of here

Should you decide to withdraw from this project please notify the others before you do so, so we can readjust (updating the site and searching for a suitable replacement for your contribution).

## Issues

If any of these happen

1. Your material has been uploaded without your knowledge
2. Your work is being used or cited inapropriately (violating licenses, not giving credit, etc. etc.)
3. You want your work removed and can't do it yourself for any reason
4. God-knows-what, can't think of any other instace

just e-mail us and we'll deal with it.
